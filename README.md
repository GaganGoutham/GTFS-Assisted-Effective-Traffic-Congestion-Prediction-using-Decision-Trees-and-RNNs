# GTFS-Project

* The GTFS, or General Transit Feed Specification, is an international standard for planning public transportation and its spatial and temporal components in metropolitan areas . 
* To create our models and make inferences, we use the city of Pune, India as a case study. The Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited makes the [Pune GTFS](http://opendata.punecorporation.org/Citizen/CitizenDatasets/Index?categoryId=15) statistics available. 
* The data is broken down into several csv files, including agency.csv, calender.csv, feed info.csv, routes.csv, shapes.csv, stop\_times.csv, stops.csv, translation.csv and trips.csv. Each of these files provides a collection of fields that can be used to determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of a given bus.
